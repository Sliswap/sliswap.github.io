**FAQ**

**What's the difference between Swap and a normal trade?**\
Swap relies on liquidity pools (Liquidity Pool) instead of an order book, enabling faster exchanges. Normal trades typically depend on matching buy and sell orders.

**Why is the amount I receive different from expected?**\
This is due to slippage, where the price fluctuates depending on trade size and market liquidity.

**What is Slippage?**\
Slippage is the difference between the expected price and the actual executed price. It usually occurs when liquidity is insufficient or the trade size is large.

**Do I need to pay fees for Swap?**\
Yes. Each Swap transaction incurs a small fee, typically including the platform protocol fee and blockchain network gas fee.

The protocol fee is charged by the platform's smart contract.

The gas fee is charged by the blockchain network.

**What is a Network Fee?**\
A **Gas Fee** is the transaction fee required to execute operations on a blockchain (such as Ethereum or the Endless chain). Its main purposes are:

**Paying miners/validators**: Gas fees incentivize miners (PoW) or validators (PoS) to process transactions and secure the blockchain.

**Preventing abuse**: Gas fees discourage spam or malicious attacks (e.g., DDoS attacks).

**Covering computational resources**: Different transactions and smart contract executions require varying computational power, so gas fees adjust dynamically based on computation, storage, and network load.

**Why did my transaction fail?**\
Common reasons include: low slippage tolerance, insufficient gas settings, insufficient liquidity in the pool, or unsupported tokens.

**How can I increase the success rate of my trade?**\
You can increase slippage tolerance, raise gas fees, or reduce the trade size.
